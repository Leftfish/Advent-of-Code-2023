# Advent of Code 2023

For the fifth time I'm trying to find out how far I can make it in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/). Results for previous editions:
* 2018: 9 days
* 2019: 13 days
* [2020](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2020): 25 days for the first time!
* [2021](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2021): 25 days for the second time!
* [2022](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2022): 25 days for the third time!

Things I **L**earned, **R**evised or **I**mproved at in 2023:

* [Day 1 Python](01/d01.py): debugging off-by-one errors (**I**), iterating with two pointers (**R**) and re.findall & re.search (**R**), because I procrastrinated by implementing this one with two methods
* [Day 2 Python](02/d02.py): itertools.chain (**L**)
* [Day 3 Python](03/d03.py): set operations (**R**), first steps with Pylint (**L**)
* [Day 4 Python](04/d04.py): using dictionaries of dictionaries to store data (**R**)
* [Day 5 Python](05/d05.py): using Python as a hand calculator, really...and finding overlaps of intervals in my not-yet-implemented alternative solution (**R**)
* [Day 6 Python](06/d06.py): implementing quadratic equations (**R**)
