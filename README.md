# Advent of Code 2023

For the fifth time I'm trying to find out how far I can make it in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/). Results for previous editions:
* 2018: 9 days
* 2019: 13 days
* [2020](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2020): 25 days for the first time!
* [2021](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2021): 25 days for the second time!
* [2022](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2022): 25 days for the third time!

Day 10 part 2 was the first real challenge and a learning experience. A visualisation on the AoC subreddit pointed me towards the proper algorithm. Day 12 part 2 is another and I haven't solved it yet. Parts 2 of days 13 and 14 are to-do because of time constraints, but I think I have the right approach for each - just haven't had the time to code them properly.

Things I **L**earned, **R**evised or **I**mproved at in 2023:

* [Day 1 Python](01/d01.py): debugging off-by-one errors (**I**), iterating with two pointers (**R**) and re.findall & re.search (**R**), because I procrastrinated by implementing this one with two methods
* [Day 2 Python](02/d02.py): itertools.chain (**L**)
* [Day 3 Python](03/d03.py): set operations (**R**), first steps with Pylint (**L**)
* [Day 4 Python](04/d04.py): using dictionaries of dictionaries to store data (**R**)
* [Day 5 Python](05/d05.py): using Python as a hand calculator, really...and finding overlaps of intervals in my not-yet-implemented alternative solution (**R**)
* [Day 6 Python](06/d06.py): implementing quadratic equations (**R**)
* [Day 7 Python](07/d07.py): collections.Counter (**R**), creating hashable objects and with custom comparators (**R**), reading comprehension (**OMG**)
* [Day 8 Python](08/d08.py): itertools.cycle (**R**)
* [Day 9 Python](09/d09.py): deque (**R**)
* [Day 10 Python](10/d10.py): the [even-odd algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even%E2%80%93odd_rule) (**L**) although the implementation is not perfect (works for the acutal input, gives off-by-one errors on test data)
* [Day 11 Python](11/d11.py): deepcopy (**R**), itertools.combinations (**R**), Manhattan distance (**R**)
* [Day 12 Python](12/d12.py) recursion (**R**) for an ugly brute-force solution of part 1, part 2 TO DO
* [Day 13 Python](13/d13.py) hash() (**R**), part 2 TO DO because hash() turned out to be a wrong design choice...
* [Day 14 Python](14/d14.py) 2d array operations (**R**) for part 1, part 2 TO DO (need to implement cycle detection)
* [Day 15 Python](15/d15.py) dictionaries/hashmaps (**R**), enums (**R**), regex (**R**), getting used to enumerate instead of for-loops (**I**)
* [Day 16 Python](16/d16.py) iterative BFS (**I**)
